# Fundamentals-of-C-Programming

Formula One (F1) Race Viewer

This project builds a program that stores and displays historical results from past F1 races. The world and constructors champions from specific years are stored and new data for future races are also accepted. This historical data is encrypted into the system and any additions to this data can be added to the encrypted database. Removal of the newly added results and further adjustments made to the results post can also be completed. 

This project utilises the Formula One API from Postman
